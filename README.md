Video SDK for Flutter

## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with Flutter Video SDK, here's a list of recommended next steps.

Not yet download the Flutter? [Download FLutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


## Usage

The SDK initialize configuration needs to be fill in `main.dart`

```dart
InitConfig initConfig = InitConfig(
  domain: "zoom.us",
  enableLog: true,
);
```

Get the Video SDK instance.

```dart
var zoom = ZoomVideoSdk();
```

Open the event channel and listen to native SDK event

```dart
var eventListener = ZoomVideoSdkEventListener();
```

Generate an [SDK JWT Token](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/video-sdk/auth/).

Then, join a session.

```dart
Map<String, bool> SDKaudioOptions = {
  "connect": true, 
  "mute": true
};
Map<String, bool> SDKvideoOptions = {
  "localVideoOn": true,
};
JoinSessionConfig joinSession = JoinSessionConfig(
  sessionName:"sessionName",
  sessionPassword: "sessionPwd",
  token: "JWT token",
  userName: "displayName",
  audioOptions: SDKaudioOptions,
  videoOptions: SDKvideoOptions,
  sessionIdleTimeoutMins: "time out minutes",
);
await zoom.joinSession(joinSession);
```
